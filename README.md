# Simple GUI Calculator

A small, beginner-friendly graphical calculator implemented as one of my initial learning projects. This repository contains a simple GUI-based calculator that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and a minimal graphical user interface. It's intended as a hands-on exercise while learning programming and GUI development.

Status
- Early learning project
- 
Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage
- Clear and backspace functionality
- Supports both button clicks and keyboard input
- Simple and readable code structure for learning and easy modification


Getting started

1. Clone the repository

   git clone https://github.com/khanshadab007/Calculator.git
   cd Calculator

2. Run the application
   - Python (Tkinter) example:
     - Prerequisite: Python 3.13 (Tkinter is included with most Python installs)
     - Run: python main.py

Usage
- Use the GUI buttons to enter numbers and operations.
- Press = (equals) or Enter( return) to compute the result.
- Use Clear to reset the input and Backspace to remove the last character.
