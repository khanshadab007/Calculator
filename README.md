# Simple GUI Calculator

A small, beginner-friendly graphical calculator implemented as one of my initial learning projects. This repository contains a simple GUI-based calculator that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and a minimal graphical user interface. It's intended as a hands-on exercise while learning programming and GUI development.

Status
- Early learning project / proof of concept

Features
- Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Clear and backspace functionality
- Clickable buttons and (where implemented) keyboard support
- Simple, easy-to-read code for learning and modification

Getting started

1. Clone the repository

   git clone https://github.com/khanshadab007/Calculator.git
   cd Calculator

2. Run the application

   The exact steps depend on the implementation language used in this repository. Below are common examples — follow the one that matches your project files.

   - Python (Tkinter) example:
     - Prerequisite: Python 3.x (Tkinter is included with most Python installs)
     - Run: python main.py

   - Java (Swing/JavaFX) example:
     - Prerequisite: JDK 8+
     - Compile: javac -d out src/*.java
     - Run: java -cp out com.example.Main

   - Electron/JavaScript example:
     - Prerequisite: Node.js (npm)
     - Install: npm install
     - Run: npm start

If your project uses a different language or structure, replace the commands above with the appropriate run steps.

Usage
- Use the GUI buttons to enter numbers and operations.
- Press = (equals) to compute the result.
- Use Clear to reset the input and Backspace to remove the last character.

Project structure (example)

- main.py or src/: main application file(s)
- README.md: this file
- assets/: optional images or icons used by the UI

Notes for learners
- Keep functions small and focused — separate UI code from calculation logic where possible.
- Add unit tests for your calculation logic so you can change the UI safely.
- Refactor to improve readability as you learn more.
